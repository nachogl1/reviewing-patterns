**Information about the kata:**
*This kata aims for the developer to use Factory Method Pattern. Lets think is a mix of Template Method and Abstract Factory
 (because there is an interface that defines how to create) and Factory (cause instead of creating a family, it creates only one object)*

**Cool Car Factory**
Create a program that can produce different types of vehicles, specifically Motorbikes and Cars. Each vehicle has
three fields: brand, model, and year. Implement a Factory Method that will define the methods for creating Motorbikes
 and Cars. The program should allow the user to input the type of vehicle they want to create (either "motorbike" or
 "car"), along with the brand, model, and year for the vehicle.
