You are working on a software project for a company that sells electronic gadgets. The company has an existing inventory
 management system that uses an outdated and proprietary database format. As part of the project, you need to integrate
  a new, modern database system with the existing inventory management system.

Your task is to develop an adapter pattern solution that will allow the new database system to seamlessly integrate
with the existing inventory management system. The adapter should be able to convert the data format used by the new
database system to the format expected by the existing inventory management system. The adapter should also provide a
uniform interface that can be used by the inventory management system to access data from the new database system.

In addition, the adapter should be designed to handle any future changes to the database systems without requiring
changes to the inventory management system. This means that the adapter should be flexible enough to accommodate any
changes to the data format or interface of the new database system, without affecting the existing inventory management system.
