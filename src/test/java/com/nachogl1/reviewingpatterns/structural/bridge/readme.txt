Create a program that allows users to view information about different types of resources, such as books or artists,
using different types of views, such as a complete view or a simple view. The program should be designed using the
 Bridge pattern to decouple the resource abstraction from its view implementation. The program should allow users to
 switch between different types of resources and views without needing to modify existing classes. For example, users
  should be able to view a complete view of a book or a simple view of an artist.
