Write a program to simulate a complex home theater system including screen, surround sound system, and DVD
 player. The system should allow the user to turn on and off the entire system with a single button press, as well as
 control the individual components (e.g. turn on/off the projector, play/pause the DVD player, adjust the volume of the
  surround sound system). Implement the system using the Facade pattern to simplify the interface and reduce the
  complexity of the interactions between the components.
