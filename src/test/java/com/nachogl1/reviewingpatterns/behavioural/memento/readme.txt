# Cool Game

Welcome to the world of Cool Game, where adventure awaits at every level! You are in charge of developing this
 exciting game which features multiple levels, each one more challenging than the last.

However, as players progress through the levels, they may want to go back to a previous level to hone their skills
or explore a different path. That's where the Memento Pattern comes in. You'll need to design a system to save and
 restore the game state, so players can return to a previous level whenever they choose.

Your game starts at "Ground Level", the first of many exciting stages. As players progress, they'll level up to
"Mid Level", "Hard Level", and "Ultimate Level", each one more challenging than the last. But no matter how far
they go, players may always find themselves returning to "Ground Level", where their journey began.

It's up to you to create a system that allows players to save their progress and return to any level they choose,
providing a seamless gaming experience that keeps them coming back for more. Are you ready to take on the challenge
 and make Cool Game the best it can be?
