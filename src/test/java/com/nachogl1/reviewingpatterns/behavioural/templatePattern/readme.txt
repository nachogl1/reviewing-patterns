# Cool Training App

You are a PT and wants to develop a way to design customised trainings for your customers. You want to start with a
Bench Press training for 3 different levels from beginner to mid and last, hard training.

According to your leaflets all your trainings follow the same structure and the content that have:

- Warmup: ("Warm up difficulty level <beginner | mid | hard>")
- Effective Sets: (the client takes care of the acclimation sets) ("Effective sets difficulty level <beginner | mid | hard>")
- Stretching: ("Stretching difficulty level <beginner | mid | hard>")

You see that there may be something you can do to design this as all the trainings follow the same structure, but they
vary the content.
