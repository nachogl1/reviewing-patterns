*This kata aims for the developer to use Iterator Pattern that allows us to iterate your own data structure,
 and implement custom behaviour*

# Cool Book Collection

Create a program that implements the Iterator design pattern to iterate over a collection of books.
The program should define a Book class with attributes such as title, author, and publication date.
 Then, create a BookCollection class that contains a list of Book objects and implements the Iterator
 pattern by defining a method that returns an iterator object for the collection. Finally, demonstrate
 the use of the iterator by iterating over the BookCollection and printing out information about each
 book in the collection.
