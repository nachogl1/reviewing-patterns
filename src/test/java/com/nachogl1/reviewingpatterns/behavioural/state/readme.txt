# Cool Mars Rover

Welcome, esteemed developer, to the Cool Mars Rover project! We're embarking on a journey to explore the
 Red Planet, and we need your expertise to design the perfect system for the Mars Rover.

One of the most important features of the Mars Rover is its ability to navigate the treacherous Martian terrain.
 To do this, we need to know the direction the Rover is facing at all times. By default, the Rover will start
 facing NORTH, but it must be able to change direction as it moves across the planet's surface.

That's where the State Pattern comes in. You'll need to design a system that allows the Rover to change its
 direction based on its movement. If it moves right, it should face EAST, and if it moves left, it should face WEST.
  Similarly, if it moves forward or backward, it should maintain its current direction.

Your solution should be robust, efficient, and easy to maintain, so our team of intrepid space explorers can
focus on the exciting discoveries ahead. With your expertise and creativity, we're confident that the Cool Mars
Rover will be a success, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
