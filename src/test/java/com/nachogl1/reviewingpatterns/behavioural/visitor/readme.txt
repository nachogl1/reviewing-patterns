# Cool Virtual Post Service

We provide a personalized and engaging experience for each of our clients.
 Our service targets different types of clients, including individuals, private institutions, public institutions, and now, international entities.

As we approach the holiday season, we want to create customized Christmas messages that are tailored to each client.
Along with the message, we'll also attach a discount coupon that can be used for a variety of items in our catalogue.

For individuals, we'll use a warm and friendly tone to wish them a happy holiday season and provide them with a 5%
discount coupon. For private institutions, we'll acknowledge their loyalty to our service and award them with a 5%
discount coupon. For public institutions, we'll express our appreciation and provide them with a generous 10% discount coupon.

But we don't stop there. We want to be able to adapt to changing client needs, which is why we're looking to add a new
type of client to our system: international entities. For them, we'll express our gratitude for trusting our services
and provide them with a 3% discount coupon on their next purchase.

To achieve this level of customization, we need a system that can adapt to different types of clients and their unique
 needs. That's where the Visitor Pattern comes in. By implementing this pattern, we can easily add new types of clients
 to our system and customize their experience with our service.

Are you ready to take on the challenge and create a seamless and engaging experience for all our clients?
