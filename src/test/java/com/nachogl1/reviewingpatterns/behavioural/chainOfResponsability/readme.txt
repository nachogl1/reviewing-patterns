# Cool Login Feature

 You have been tasked with creating a robust and secure login system for our platform.

The login process will be completed in three steps: first, the system will check if the provided username exists;
second, the system will verify that the password provided is correct. This design is highly adaptable and can easily
 accommodate future changes or additions, allowing for seamless updates and improvements to the login process.

But the work doesn't stop there! As our platform grows, it's important to ensure that only authorized personnel have
 access to sensitive information. That's where the next step comes in: verifying the role of the user. With this added
 level of security, we can ensure that only users with the proper privileges can access confidential information.

Your challenge is to design a flexible and scalable login system that meets the needs of our growing platform. Whether
you need to add additional checks or make updates to existing ones, your solution should be able to handle it with ease.
 With your help, we can create a powerful and secure login system that provides a seamless experience for our users.
