# Cool Cars

We are excited to introduce you to our latest software module for our line of amazing cars - Cool Cars.

Our cars are equipped with cutting-edge technology that allows them to connect to the internet and receive regular
software updates. These updates come in the form of basic strings that indicate the version of the new software.

Currently, we have three different car models - The Cool, The Nice, and The Superb. We are looking to develop a new
 update mechanism that will notify all cars of the new software version when the main factory triggers an update,
 specifically when we release the new version V10.0.1.

Your challenge is to define a model that will allow all cars connected to the internet to be notified of this new
 update, and to print the message "Car <carName> received new update V10.0.1" for each car that receives the update.
 This will ensure that all our customers are up-to-date with the latest software and have the best possible driving experience.

We look forward to seeing your solution and making Cool Cars the best it can be!
