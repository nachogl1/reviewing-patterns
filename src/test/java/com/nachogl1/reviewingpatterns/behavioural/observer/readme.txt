# Cool Cars

Our company has developed a new software module that updates the main software core of the cars we manufacture.
The cars are equipped with technology that allows them to be connected to internet in order to receive new updates,
this new updates are basics strings with the version of the new update.

The company currently has 3 different car models:

- The Cool
- The Nice
- The Superb

Define a model in which when the main factory triggers the update V10.0.1 all the cars observing
for updates are notified of it.

And the cars will print "Car <carName> received new update V10.0.1".
