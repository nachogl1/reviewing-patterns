We have three types of factories: Factory Template Method, Abstract Factory, and Factory.

Abstract Factory handles the creation of a family of objects.

Factory and Factory Method handles the creation of one object but in different ways.

In Factory, you have the creation logic in the same factory for all the objects.
In Factory Method, you have a base class that defines how a factory works, and different implementations of
 this factory that create one object, with the logic staying inside that class.
